### Game Description

Have you ever thought about how you would fare under a zombie apocalypse? This game was made with Unity, and challenges the player to survive as long as possible as zombies randomly instantiate around them. 

Players have three lives, and will lose a life when coming into contact with a zombie. Players also lose when they run out of ammo.

Barrels are instantiated around the player, and players can run into the barrel to collect more ammo.
